Amanda has worked in a shop dealing in antiquarian books, created assembly instructions and repairs in a warehouse, and as a procurement specialist for Microsoft. Her first degree was in visual arts, but it is her interest in combining the technical and digital with books that has led her to the [Rare Books and Digital Humanities masters](https://rare-book-and-digital-humanities.ubfc.fr/) in Besan√ßon, France.
