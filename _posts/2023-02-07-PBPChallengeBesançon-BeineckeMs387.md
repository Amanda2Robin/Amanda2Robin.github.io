# **The Paris Bible Challenge: Besançon**

## **Beinecke MS 387 and Transkribus**

<br>

In January 2023, year one students of the [Rare Books and Digital Humanties](https://www.ubfc.fr/en/formations/masters/master-rare-book-and-digital-humanities/) masters at UBFC were asked by the team behind the Paris Bible Project (PBP) to participate in a manuscript transcription Correct-a-thon. We were separated into small teams for this challenge and then tasked with editing the AI transcribed pages from different Paris Bibles. To achieve this, we were taught how to use the text analysis platform Transkribus, which was loaded with an AI model that was built to specifically recognize and transcribe the characters, abbreviations and accents from Paris Bibles. 

<br>

Our group was given the Bible identified as "Beinecke MS 387," a 13th century Bible potentially made either in England or Northern France. The transcription of the Bibles were not only an individual project, because at the end of the correction challenge the pages the entire group were able to fully transcribe were added to the model’s reference bank, helping the model lower its error rate by 2%. What follows is our team’s observations and comments on the "Beinecke MS 387" Bible and the challenge. 

<br>

Together with our teammates, we set out to correct the transcription of the beginning of Genesis. We optimistically attempted multiple pages, but we ran into several issues and discussing possible solutions amongst ourselves delayed our task. The first challenge we faced was making sense of the Bible's words, letters and punctuation marks, since typography, calligraphy and grammar rules back when this book was made were quite different from modern day languages. Understanding the passages was no easy feat but between the PBP Transcription [Guidelines](https://parisbible.github.io/guidelines/) and a Vulgate Latin Bible for reference we were able to decipher the scribe's meaning. 

<br>

## **Observations of the Scribe**

<br>

However practical and useful the guidelines were in the beginning, we soon realised that these weren't entirely reliable. The more lines we corrected, the more we began to note the amount of inconsistencies within words that didn't respond to any given rule or reason in their spelling choice. An example of this happens for the word secundum, which appeared numerous times in the text, but was abbreviated or written in different ways, seemingly at random. The word could appear as ſcꝺ̄m, but could also sometimes be abbreviated as ſcꝺ̄ō, but rarely, if at all, was secundum ever entirely written out. 

<br>

<br>

This was also the case for the word deus, which was generally abbreviated as ꝺs̄ with a macron between the first and second letter. In some instances, we noticed that the full word would be written out with no indication why sometimes it would be abbreviated and sometimes not. 

<br>

<br>

This begs the question of why have such a variety in abbreviations for the same word, and why is it that on a single leaf, there appears to be no logic behind the decision of which abbreviation gets used. One could hypothesize that the choice of abbreviations is related to the remaining space on the line, or, maybe, it could simply be because such abbreviations appeared this way in our scribe’s reference Bible, and he was just copying what was in front of him. Either way, the copyist who transcribed the Beinecke MS 387 Bible was consistently inconsistent in his abbreviations and in his refusal to create uniformity throughout, which made the transcription that much more fun and interesting.

<br>

Next, the international network for copyists during the 13th century was evidently basically non-existent and therefore, no standard was put into place to regulate abbreviations. While there are a few abbreviations that seem to be universal in Paris Bibles, like the macron over a letter to replace an "m" or an "n" and to combine letters which turned words like "habent" into hn̄t, some of the abbreviations the copyist for the Beinecke MS 387 appear to be less common (Fig. 3). Among these uncommon abbreviations that were recurring in our Bible were gᔆ, which stood in for the word "igitur" (Fig. 4) and qͦ, which replaced "quod" (Fig. 5). Furthermore, in the 39th row of the second column of the first page, there is an abbreviation which we could not confidently decipher. We believe this word to represent eius (Fig. 6) but because of the low picture, occurrences like this one became like this one were difficult to interpret, especially since our scribe was not the most consistent nor the most clear to begin with.

<br>

Other inconsistency issues we noticed during the correction process occurred with capitalization of words at the start of new paragraphs. Our scribe would illogically capitalize words when there was no new section, or sometimes even use capitals in the middle of a line, as happened often with the word et in the example below, found in page 5, column 2, line 5 of Beinecke 387. In other cases, capital words are more clearly more evident thanks to the use of color.

<br>

Other times, the scribe would make mistakes such as altering the order of the words or adding others (we corroborated this by following a vulgar latin version of the Genesis text.) They would also erroneously or purposefully omit words and in some cases they would add them above the line where they originally should have been. Other times, they crossed out a word or even wrote them twice because the first attempt had come out illegible, as was the case with this repeated word tertius in the last line of page 1, column 1, paragraph 3. Although the word wasn’t crossed out, the scribe wrote it down a second time, perhaps thinking the first attempt wasn’t visible enough.

<br>

## **Transkribus in Action**

<br>

Insert examples of times that Transkribus got it right when we had difficulty figuring it out, particularly long words with a lot of Us, facientem.

<br>

Repeating machine transcription mistakes: c = t, ct = d, e=c, rt=u, c=i, rn=m, h=b, H=N, s=o.

<br>

## **Recommendations**

<br>

The usage of 3 to stand for "ue" and often used with q to stand for "que" as indicated on the Guidelines is reflected in our experience with this manuscript. However, the scribe's handwriting gives that 3 a variety of appearances and occassionally appears as a semi-colon. Adding an example or two of the variety of 3s would be beneificial to any future crowdsourced transcription work.

|---|---|---|
| Figure 10: qꝫ appearing as q;  | Figure 11: qꝫ appearing as neither | Figure 12: qꝫ appearing as qꝫ  |

<br>

The reversed question mark, ⸮, is also present in the Guidelines and said to stand for the usual question mark. In this manuscript, the ⸮ shows up repeatedly and does not appear to represent any word or punctuation. It would be a good idea to note that in the Guidelines.
